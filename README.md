# Nodejs and the reflashed LYWSD03MMC

* find-thermometer/ searches for reflashed LYWSD03MMC so you can quickly see they work as well as their name (generally the name is ATC_XXYYZZ with XXYYZZ the last 3 bytes of their MAC address in hex)
* read-thermometer/ reads specific thermometers and prints out human readable or telegraf/InfluxDB compatible temperature, humidity and battery data
